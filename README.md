solution of projects of the Machine Learning course in edX (available link: https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-columbiax-csmm-102x-1 ) using python 3. I tried to solve them in the best way I got in a short time. All dataset were created manually using sklearn library or downloaded. The topics of the projects along the course are the following:

1. Regression (linear and Ridge)
2. Classification (K-bayes classifier)
3. Clustering (K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model)
4.
